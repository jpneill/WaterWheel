WaterWheel
==========

A chaotic waterwheel is a physical model that demonstrates the Lorenz system of equations in non-linear dynamics. It consists of a standard waterwheel with the exception that each bucket on the wheel has a hole drilled in the base where water can drain out.

This program simulates the motion of a chaotic waterwheel under different initial conditions. The equations of motion are solved by mathematica which returns an array detailing the change in angle of the system and the current mass of fluid in each container at each time step.

Requires mathematica to run.
